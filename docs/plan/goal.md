# Project Goals

This document outlines the strategic goals and vision for the TYPO3 Quality Tools package.

## Vision

To provide TYPO3 developers with a comprehensive, standardized, and easy-to-use solution for maintaining high code quality across different projects. We envision a development ecosystem where code quality assurance is seamless, consistent, and accessible to teams of all sizes.

## Core Concept

The TYPO3 Quality Tools package serves as a unified collection of preconfigured code quality tools specifically tailored for TYPO3 development. Rather than requiring developers to configure and maintain multiple quality tools individually, this package provides:

1. **Standardized Configurations**: Pre-configured setups for essential quality tools (Rector, Fractor, PHPStan, PHP CS Fixer, TypoScript Lint) that follow TYPO3 best practices and coding standards.

2. **TYPO3-Optimized Settings**: Each tool is configured specifically for TYPO3 projects, targeting PHP 8.3+, TYPO3 v13.4, and incorporating TYPO3-specific patterns and conventions.

3. **Unified Command Interface**: A simplified approach to running quality tools through Symfony console commands that abstract away the complexity of individual tool configurations and provide consistent, intuitive interfaces for common quality assurance tasks.

4. **Zero-Configuration Integration**: Drop-in solution that works out of the box for TYPO3 projects without requiring extensive setup or configuration knowledge.

## Benefits

### For Development Teams
- **Reduced Setup Time**: Eliminates the need to research, configure, and maintain multiple quality tools
- **Consistent Standards**: Ensures all team members use the same quality configurations and coding standards
- **Simplified Workflow**: Single package installation provides access to all necessary quality tools
- **TYPO3-Specific Optimizations**: Tools are preconfigured with TYPO3 best practices and conventions

### For Project Maintainers
- **Standardized Quality Gates**: Consistent quality checks across all TYPO3 projects
- **Automated Code Modernization**: Rector and Fractor configurations help maintain up-to-date code
- **Reduced Maintenance Overhead**: Centralized tool configurations reduce per-project maintenance

### For the TYPO3 Community
- **Quality Consistency**: Promotes uniform code quality standards across the ecosystem
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Makes professional-grade quality tools accessible to all skill levels
- **Best Practice Distribution**: Spreads TYPO3 coding standards and modernization patterns

## Impact

### Immediate Impact
- **Faster Project Setup**: Developers can establish quality assurance workflows in minutes rather than hours
- **Improved Code Quality**: Immediate access to static analysis, code style fixing, and modernization tools
- **Reduced Configuration Errors**: Pre-tested configurations eliminate common setup mistakes

### Medium-Term Impact
- **Standardization**: Widespread adoption leads to more consistent code quality across TYPO3 projects
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Simplified workflows encourage more frequent use of quality tools
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Best practices embedded in configurations help educate developers

### Long-Term Impact
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Higher overall code quality across the TYPO3 ecosystem
- **Maintainability Improvement**: Automated modernization and standardization reduce technical debt
- **Innovation Enablement**: Developers spend less time on tooling setup and more time on feature development

### Strategic Objectives

1. **Simplify Quality Tool Usage**: Provide unified Symfony console commands that abstract complex tool configurations
2. **Promote TYPO3 Best Practices**: Embed community-approved standards and patterns in tool configurations
3. **Enable Continuous Quality**: Make it easy for teams to integrate quality checks into their development workflows
4. **Support TYPO3 Evolution**: Keep pace with TYPO3 releases and PHP version requirements through maintained configurations
5. **Foster Community Adoption**: Lower barriers to quality tool usage to increase adoption across the TYPO3 community

This project represents a strategic investment in the long-term health and sustainability of TYPO3 development practices, providing the foundation for a more mature and standardized development ecosystem.
